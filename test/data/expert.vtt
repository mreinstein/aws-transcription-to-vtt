maximise brand loyalty and enhance
intangible assets in pursuit of these

4
00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.000
objectives we start a new project for
to require seven red lines i understand

5
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.000
your company can help us in this matter.
Of course water here will be the

6
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.000
project manager water we can do this
come way yes, of course anderson here

7
00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.000
is our expert in all matters related
the drawing red lines we've brought him

8
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.000
along today to share his professional
opinion nice to meet you well you all

9
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.000
know me

10
00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:35.000
this is justine, our company's design
specialist hello

11
00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:41.000
we need you to draw seven red lines all
of them strictly perpendicular some

12
00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:42.000
with green ink and some of transparent

13
00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:44.000
can you do that?

14
00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.000
No i'm afraid that's not russian any
hasty answers anderson the task has

15
00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.000
been said it needs to be carried out at
the end of the day you are an expert

16
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:57.000
the term redline implies the color of
the line to be read to draw a red line

17
00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:58.000
with green ink is

18
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.000
well it's not exactly impossible it's
pretty close to being impossible what

19
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.000
does that even mean? Impossible? I mean
it is possible there some people say

20
00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.000
suffering from color blindness for whom
the colored lines doesn't really make a

21
00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:10.000
difference

22
00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.000
but i'm quite sure that the target
audience of your project doesn't

23
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:17.000
consist solely of such people is
invincible this is possible

24
00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:24.000
i'll simplify line as such can be drawn
with absolutely any ink, but if you

25
00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.000
want to get a red line you need to use
ready

26
00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:29.000
what if we draw them with blue? It
could

27
00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:31.000
it still won't work

28
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.000
if you use blue ink, you'll get two
lines

29
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.000
and what exactly did you mean when you
talked about the transparent?

30
00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.000
How to explain

31
00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:44.000
i'm sure you know what transparent
means

32
00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.000
yes and what a red

33
00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.000
line means i hope i don't need to
explain to you what you need to draw

34
00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.000
red line

35
00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:55.000
with transparent ing

36
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.000
you described what you imagined the end
result would look like come on and see

37
00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.000
what we got kindergarden way let's not
waste our time with these unproductive

38
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.000
quarrels the task has been set the task
is plain and clear

39
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.000
now if you have any specific questions
then go ahead. You'll get that here.

40
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh right let's leave aside the color
for the moment you had something there

41
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.000
also relating to perpendicular pretty
seven lines all strictly perpendicular

42
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.000
to what

43
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.000
two

44
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.000
everything amongst themselves. I seemed
you know what happens if your lines

45
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.000
alive because he does he's an expert

46
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.000
two lines can be perpendicular. All
seven can be simultaneously

47
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.000
perpendicular to each other.

48
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.000
I'll show you

49
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.000
this is a line, right?

50
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes,

51
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.000
and another

52
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.000
is it perpendicular to the first line?

53
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.000
Well

54
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.000
yes, it is perpendicular exactly wait,
wait i'm not done and a third one is it

55
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.000
perpendicular to the first line?

56
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.000
Yes, it is but it doesn't cross the
second line they're both parallel

57
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.000
not perpendicular

58
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.000
i

59
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.000
suppose so

60
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.000
there it is

61
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.000
two lines can can i have a pen?

62
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.000
How about this?

63
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.000
This is a triangle

64
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.000
it's definitely not perpendicular lines
and their three not seven

65
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.000
why they blew andy don't trust that
myself

66
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.000
i have a blue pen with me this was just
a demonstrates the problem your lines

67
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.000
simple who draw them with reading it
wants off the problem how do you know

68
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.000
before you've tried it that's drawing
with reddick then let's see, i don't

69
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.000
have a red pen with me but i'm
completely certain that with reading

70
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.000
the result will still be the same. But
didn't you tell us earlier that you

71
00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.000
could only draw red lines with red ink

72
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.000
if it gets written that down here and
now you want to draw with blue nick, do

73
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.000
you want us to call these red lines?

74
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.000
I understand you know you're not
talking about the color now, right?

75
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You're talking about that

76
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.000
what you call a perp in dick dick think
temerity yes that's it now you've

77
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.000
confused everyone so what exactly is
stopping us from doing this

78
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.000
geometry?

79
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.000
Just ignore it we have a tusk seven red
lines it's not twenty is just seven

80
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.000
anderson i understand you're a
specialist of a narrow field you don't

81
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.000
see the overall picture but surely it's
not a difficult task to draw some seven

82
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.000
line exactly suggest a solution that
any fool can criticize no offense but

83
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.000
you're an expert and you should know
better

84
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.000
okay

85
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.000
let me draw you too perfectly
perpendicular red lines and i will draw

86
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.000
the rest with transparent ink they'll
be invisible but i'll draw them

87
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.000
would deceive us

88
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.000
yes this will do just

89
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.000
yes, but at least a couple with

90
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
greeting oh, i have another question if
i may can you draw one of the lines in

91
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.000
the form of a kitten

92
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.000
but

93
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.000
in the form of a kitten market research
tells us our users like cute animals it

94
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.000
would be really great if you know

95
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.000
why

96
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.000
look, i can of course draw you a cat

97
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.000
no artist but i can give it a try but

98
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.000
it won't be a line anymore it will be a
cat, a line and a cat these are two

99
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.000
different things

100
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.000
not a cat

101
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.000
with a kitten

102
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.000
a little

103
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.000
cute

104
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.000
cuddly

105
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.000
cats on the other hand what

106
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.000
anderson at least hear her out she
hasn't even finished speaking and you

107
00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:07.000
already saying no i got the idea but
it's impossible to draw a line in the

108
00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:08.000
form of a cat

109
00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:11.000
what about a bird

110
00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:19.000
so where do we stop what we're doing?
Seven red lines or two with red ink to

111
00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:22.000
with green ink in the rest with
transparent that understand correctly?

112
00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:27.000
Yes, excellent, in which case that's
everything right, i almost forgot. We

113
00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:30.000
also have a red moon. Do you know if
you could inflate it?

114
00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:35.000
What do i have to

115
00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:40.000
do with balloons? It's anderson, can
you or can you not do this? A simple

116
00:06:40.845 --> 00:06:41.000
question,

117
00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:42.000
it's. Such a can,

118
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.000
of course, but excellent. Organize a
business trip

119
00:06:46.035 --> 00:06:47.000
will cover the expenses,

120
00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:50.000
go over to their location,

121
00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:51.000
inflate the balloon

122
00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:54.000
well, this is very productive. Thank
you all.

123
00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:10.000
Can i ask you one more question, please.

124
00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:14.000
When you inflate the balloon, could you
do it in the form of a kitten?

125
00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.000
Of course i can. I can't do anything

126
00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:21.000
i can do absolutely anything

127
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.000
i'm in expert.
